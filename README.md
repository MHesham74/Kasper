# 🌐 Kasper Website

This is my **second HTML and CSS project**, inspired by the [Kasper template design](https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-psd-template).  
It’s a simple **responsive website** built to practice layout, styling, and clean code organization.

The Kasper Website is a static web page created using **only HTML and CSS**.  
It focuses on building a professional website layout that includes:
- Header and navigation bar
